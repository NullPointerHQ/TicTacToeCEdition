# ðŸ‘‹Introduction
This project was my final exam for my Programming 1 course. It is outdated now as I have both improved my skills as a programmer as well as moved to different languages, even recreating this project in [Python](https://github.com/NullPointerHQ/TicTacToePythonEdition). It should also be noted that I was provided a basic skeleton for this however the majority of the program is of my own design.
### Project Objectives
This program should simulate a game of TicTacToe between two players and includes the following features:
1. Basic Command-Line-Interface (CLI) board
2. Automatic Win/Draw/Loss Detector
3. Save/load function.
4. Randomized player icons, and starting order assignment.

### Universal Prerequisites
  - Language Used: C, this project was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022, but most any C compiler should be able to run this program.
  - IDE: [Microsoft's Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/#vs-section)

  - C's `time.h` Library
